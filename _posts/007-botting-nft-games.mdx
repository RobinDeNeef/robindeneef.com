My workload has been ramping up at work, so I didnâ€™t have a lot of energy for other things this week. I got bitten a bit by the NFT bug. And I have been reading up a lot on it. The current state of the NFT landscape does feel to me like mostly a cash grab. But I think it has some potential. 

Certificates, achievements, and badges would be great as NFT but it would be stupid to make them tradeable since you donâ€™t want to grind multiple hours to get an achievement if somebody else can just buy it. Most of the projects also donâ€™t have any real utility, only promises. Iâ€™m quite curious how it will evolve. 

Most of the games that do exist feel a bit like early 2010 browser games, where I spend loads of time. But currently, for every action, you do you have to confirm a transaction. This doesnâ€™t feel very user friendly, nor cheap. 

I also stumbled upon a tweet of someone who was making quite some money with a bot he had created for an NFT game. This was genius, botting on Runescape might have been one of my first experiences with coding and automating. (Sorry Jagex ðŸ™ƒ). 

I wanted to implement some bots myself. It adds zero value to the NFT space but if other people can go for cash grabs, so can I! Or at least I thought so at that moment. I spend some time setting up a bot for Bridgeworld. But most games require you to already have an NFT to play the game. Most NFT prices for these games start at a couple of thousand euros. Not really what I want to spend on it. I got stuck at automatically accepting transactions afterwards I kind of gave up for now. 

I used a small script to execute some clicks at certain locations at a certain interval and thatâ€™s it for now. If anything changes about the game my script will crash and burn and maybe accidentally confirm a transaction sending all my money away, so itâ€™s not really running at the time. ðŸ˜…

However, I did find some interesting resources if you want to get into Blockchain Programming.
