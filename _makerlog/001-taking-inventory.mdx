_New year, new intentions._

With the beginning of the new year. I'd like to set myself some new intentions. One of them is to sort through my graveyard of unfinished and abandoned projects and actually finish a few. But let's start with one.

For January, I will focus on setting up systems and cataloging everything I already have created in the past.

One of the things I want to do is post a weekly update, here in my maker log. Both for me to look back on and to keep myself publicly accountable.

This week I focused on setting up a new workflow in Notion. Made an overview of all the projects I have and added analytics to them. So I can see if any of the landing pages already have any traffic. I’ll also create a small form in Google Forms to see if people actually click through. Maybe they will leave some useful feedback?

For Analytics I chose [Plausible.io](http://plausible.io?ref=robindeneef.com), they are privacy friendly analytics tool. They are lightweight and open-source. I also liked their interface. I’ve configured Plausible to send me a mail every month for every domain. I will need to find a way to track these numbers over the year.

That’s it for week one of 2022. I have a GCP Security Engineer exam coming up at the end of the month. So I don’t think I will be able to spend a lot of time on side projects. But I will be able to write some content for [GCPSecured.com](http://GCPSecured.com?ref=robindeneef.com)
