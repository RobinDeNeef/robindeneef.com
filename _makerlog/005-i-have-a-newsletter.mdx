This week was a bit all over the place. Last weekend I had a talk with a friend who had sold a simple NFT generator for 15 000 euros. So I did the only sensible thing and tried to build one myself. After 4 hours I had something working if I only I were a better artist. But this got me a bit down the NFT rabbit hole again. I had mostly avoided NFT’s since I think it’s a big hype and current NFT projects are not bringing a lot of value. But I might rethink my stance and whip up one or more MVPs if I can find some time. 

I also did a deep dive in the power glove I bought a couple of weeks ago. I think I’ve figured out most of the inner workings of the device and placed an order for new components. They should arrive before the weekend so you can already guess what the next maker log will be about! 

And finally some real work! I noticed that my website and blog post didn’t have any meta tags or open graph tags. So I spend some time updating my blog generator code and use it to generate these tags for every page based on metadata like the featured image etc. Since we also ended the first month of the year I hastily decided on starting a monthly newsletter. You can find that one on [https://robindeneef.substack.com/](https://robindeneef.substack.com/)

Work at my day job is ramping up so I might take my foot off the gas a little in the coming weeks. But don’t fret. I will be playing with electronics during every free moment I can find.
